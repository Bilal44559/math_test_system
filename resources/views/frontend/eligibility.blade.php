                  TM Academy courses are open to students under 18 years of age, ensuring a supportive, engaging, and age-appropriate learning environment.</p>

<p>The age limit may be relaxed on a case-by-case basis; inquiries should be made prior to enrollment.</p>
<p>Enrollment in a formal school is not required.</p>
<p>Placement is determined through a short online diagnostic test designed to assess each student’s current ability and match them with the course best suited to their learning level.</p>
<p>Students whose diagnostic results indicate learning needs outside the scope of the offered courses may not be admitted, to ensure that every participant receives effective and appropriate instruction.</p>
<p>Enrollment is offered on a first-come, first-served basis until all available spots are filled.</p>
<p>
    The targeted class size for each level is 20 students, ensuring personalized attention and an engaging learning environment. Enrolment may be extended up to 25 students if demand is high and adequate resources are available to maintain instructional quality.
